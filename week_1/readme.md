And then output the records in a tabular form with class average, class highest and class lowest at end in the following format.

- Use dictionaries (list of dictionaries in exact)
- Insert atleast 5 records
- Input must be user-given
- (Optional) validate the user input, i.e marks aren't greater 100 and other such validations you think there might be

In this program,i created a list of dictionary then adding record as an input in dictionary then append the dictionaries in to the empty list also reated a function which calculates the highest,average and lowest marks in the record
Here is the output
